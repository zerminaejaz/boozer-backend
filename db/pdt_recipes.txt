ABSINTHE DRIP

This is the classic preparation for absinthe, which traditionally ranges from 60% to 68% alcohol by volume. The water helps release the aromatic elements of the spirit and dilutes it to a potable strength.

1.5 oz. Vieux Pontarlier Absinthe

4.5-6 oz. Ice-Cold Filtered Water

1 Sugar Cube

Pour absinthe into a chilled absinthe glass. Place an absinthe spoon over the rim of the glass and set a sugar cube on top of the spoon. Using an absinthe fountain or water carafe, slowly pour or drip icecold water over the sugar cube into the glass. As the dripping water dissolves the sugar cube, watch the “hydrophobic” layer of undiluted absinthe rise to the top of the glass. When the mixture is completely cloudy, the drip should be ready. Stir and serve.
